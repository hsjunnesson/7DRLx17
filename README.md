This is my project for the [2021 Seven Day Roguelike Challenge](https://7drl.com/).

This is a work in process - in fact, the challenge hasn't even started yet.

## Installing

Should you ever wish to build and run this - why would you? Make sure you have the following dependencies installed, for instance via `vcpkg`:

- [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/)
- [SDL2-Image](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/)
- [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/)

Cmake will download and build the following projects:

- [StackWalker](https://github.com/JochenKalmbach/StackWalker/)
- [Bitsquid Foundation](https://github.com/hsjunnesson/bitsquid-foundation/)

The art assets used for the game is Kenney's [Micro Roguelike](https://www.kenney.nl/assets/micro-roguelike/) tileset.
